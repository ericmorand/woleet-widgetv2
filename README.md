# Woleet widgets (version 2)

## Build

```bash
npm i
npm run build
```

# File Hasher widget

This widget allows to drop or download a file, compute its hash and preview it.

## Integration

To integrate one or several widgets in a web page, first insert the following code:

```javascript
<script>
  (function (d,s,i,f) {
    var js = d.createElement(s); var fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
    js.id = i; js.src = f; js.async = 1; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
  }(document, 'script', 'file-hasher-widget', '<url_to_script>/file-hasher-widget.js'));
</script>
```

You can also integrate it directly like this:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" id="file-hasher-widget" src="<url_to_script>/file-hasher-widget.js"></script>
```

Note that you need to replace *<url_to_script>* with the actual path of the script.

Then, instantiate the widget by creating a `<div>` tag with a `class="file-hasher-widget"` attribute:

```html
<div class="file-hasher-widget"></div>
```

## Configuration

### Attributes

The following attributes can be set on `<div>` tag to configure the look and behavior of the widget (see [Usage](#Usage) for more details).

    * __widgetReset__ - is called when the widget is reset. Parameters: ___widgetId___;

### Usage

There are several ways to configure the widget:

* All parameters are in the attribute <b>config</b> as JSON object:

```html
<div class="file-hasher-widget" config='{"file": {"url": "http://pngimg.com/uploads/google/google_PNG19644.png"}, "observers": {"hashCalculated": "hashCalculated", "fileDownloaded": "fileDownloadedObserver"}}'></div>
```
* The parameters are attributes of the HTML element:

```html
<div class='file-hasher-widget'
     lang='fr'
     file='{"url": "http://pngimg.com/uploads/google/google_PNG19634.png", "fastDownload": true}'
     observers='{"hashCalculated": "test.hashCalculated"}'></div>
 ```
* If a option has nested options they can be set also as HTML attributes by joining via '-' in lower case:

```html
<div class='file-hasher-widget'
     id='file-hasher-widget-de'
     observers-hashCalculated='window.hashCalculated'
     lang='fr'></div>
```

The dynamic initialization is also available. It is realized using the method __init__ of the widget. The an example in the file [examples/file-hasher-widget-delayed-several-instances-example.html](examples/file-hasher-widget-delayed-several-instances-example.html)

You can dynamically reset the widget while keeping the same configuration with the method __reset__ of the widget.

## Examples

### Embed the widget in a regular web page

See [examples/file-hasher-widget-example.html](examples/file-hasher-widget-example.html) for an example about how to insert the widget in a web page.

## Development

### Proxy Server

To allow the widget to download a file, the file URL must be proxied, or the URL must support CORS.

For testing, a Node.js server is provided. This simple server simply redirect the resource flow to the widget.
Execute next command to launch the server:

```bash
cd ./server
node app
```
